# Pyanoboard
_Pyanoboard_ is a simple piano to keyboard emulator. It allows you to use any MIDI enabled device as a virtual keyboard.

Pyanoboard actually simulates key events rather than sending characters to be typed, which means you can use it for anything such as gaming and not just typing.

### Prerequisites

- MIDI enabled device such as a digital piano
- MIDI to USB cable
- `python` and `pip`
- Windows
